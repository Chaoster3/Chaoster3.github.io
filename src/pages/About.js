        Hi there, I'm Sam! I'm currently a student at the University of Pennsylvania pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Engineering in Computer Science at the School of Engineering and Applied Science and a Bachelor's of Science in Economics at the Wharton School.

         I've always been fascinated by how technology can be used to solve tough problems and shape the future. 
         This has led me to explore diverse engineering experiences addressing challenges in a variety of fields<code>&#8212;</code> from gravitational waves to multi-agent pathfinding to surgical robotics.

         <p className='text-2xl' align="left">In my free time, you can find me climbing rocks, reading books, or looking for the best food trucks.
